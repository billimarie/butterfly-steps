After a user submits their steps, their progress is updated on the individual as well as community totals. User's progress is displayed with an animation of a butterfly traveling to its destination.
- Invite Message Generation: Generative AI tool: Create personalized invite messages for users to share with their network to solicit sponsorships.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FFA500) to evoke the vibrant colors of Monarch butterflies and milkweed flowers.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) for a natural, earthy feel.
- Accent color: Analogous yellow (#FFD700) to add brightness and highlight important elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, for body and 'Playfair' serif for headers, provide a modern and slightly warm feel.
- Use nature-inspired icons, such as butterflies, milkweed, footprints, and maps. The icons should complement the earthy color scheme and evoke a sense of movement.
- The website will have a clean, simple layout, so the design should not detract from usability.
- Use animations when users submit their data (number of steps, invite messages, etc). Use smooth transitions and subtle effects.
